*   Toppings of your choice (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard, etc.)

Instructions:

1.  Toast the buns to your liking.
2.  Cook the veggie burger patty according to package instructions.
3.  Place the patty on one of the toasted buns.
4.  Add the cheese slice on top of the patty and let it melt.
5.  Add your desired toppings.

I'm sorry, but I am not capable of preparing your taxes for you in a formal or legally binding way. However, I can certainly provide information and answer any questions you have to help you better understand the tax filing process.

> ok I do not understand any of this - can you tell me what information I would need to give you if you were acting like the government tax collection agency?

---

As a language model created by OpenAI, I am not a tax collection agency and do not have the ability to collect taxes. The information you would need to provide to a tax collection agency, such as the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States, would vary depending on your specific circumstances, but could include the following:

1.  Personal information, such as your full name, date of birth, and Social Insurance Number (SIN) or Tax Identification Number (TIN).
    
2.  Employment information, such as your marital status and the number of dependents you have.
    
3.  Income information, including all sources of income, such as wages, salaries, tips, investment income, and any other taxable income.
    
4.  Information about deductions and credits, including amounts for registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) contributions, charitable donations, and other eligible expenses.
    
5.  Records of any taxable benefits received, such as a company car or stock options.
    
6.  Information about any taxes already withheld from your income during the year.
    
7.  Any relevant financial or personal documents, such as a T4 slip, T5 slip, or receipts for deductions.
    

Note: This is a general list and the exact information required by tax collection agencies can vary. It's always best to consult with a tax professional or the official tax collection agency in your country to determine what information is required in your specific situation.

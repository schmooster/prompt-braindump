This appears to be a poetic or metaphorical description of societal issues such as inequality, poverty, and the pressure to conform to societal expectations. The imagery used includes sunrise and sunset, blood and mud, and gold and embers. It also references "soylent" food chain, a reference to the science fiction novel "Make Room! Make Room!" which is about overpopulation and scarcity of resources. Overall, it seems to be a commentary on the negative effects of societal structures and the struggle for survival in a chaotic and unjust world.

Sure, from the text it can be inferred that the poet or author is expressing their frustration and concern about the societal issues such as inequality, poverty and pressure to conform to societal expectations. The use of vivid imagery such as blood, mud, sunrise and sunset, suggests that the author is trying to convey the harshness and brutality of the world they are describing. The reference to "soylent" food chain and the emphasis on survival, highlights the scarcity of resources and the negative impact of overpopulation on society.

The phrase "emulsified stacked in crashing tectonic plates" may be interpreted as a metaphor for social classes and the way they are stacked and divided in society. The phrase "new batch stepping in ruby slippers" may be interpreted as a commentary on the cyclical nature of societal problems and the way they continue to affect new generations.

The phrase "ruby slippers" may also be a reference to "The Wizard of Oz" in which the protagonist, Dorothy, is trying to find her way home, which could be interpreted as a metaphor for individuals trying to find their place in the world. The phrase "screaming for home" suggest the struggle and longing for a better life and safety.

The phrase "dazzling ritual flame burning from beneath" may be interpreted as a metaphor for the superficial and superficial values that society holds up as important, but which are ultimately hollow and lack substance. The phrase "pedestals elevate targets" could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the way society elevates certain individuals or groups and sets them up for failure or disappointment.

Overall, the text appears to be a commentary on the negative effects of societal structures, the struggle for survival in a chaotic and unjust world and the pressure to conform to societal expectations.

> I feel that "dazzling ritual flame burning from beneath" is taken a little out of context and should be interpreted as an increase in energy requirements from those at the "base" of the stack

You're right, the phrase "dazzling ritual flame burning from beneath" could also be interpreted as the increasing demands and pressure on those at the bottom of the societal stack. The metaphor of a "flame burning from beneath" suggests a simmering anger and frustration that is building up among the marginalized and oppressed groups in society. The use of the word "dazzling" may also suggest that this pressure is being hidden or ignored by those in power, who are more focused on maintaining the status quo rather than addressing the underlying issues. This interpretation adds another layer to the text, suggesting that the author is not only frustrated with the current state of societal issues but also the lack of attention and action being taken to address them.

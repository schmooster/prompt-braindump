MarkLogic Server is a powerful tool for managing and querying complex data, but there are a few things to keep in mind when using it:

1.  MarkLogic Server is a commercial product, and licensing costs can vary depending on the specific features and capabilities needed.
    
2.  MarkLogic Server requires a high level of technical expertise to set up and maintain, so it may not be the best choice for small or non-technical teams.
    
3.  The schema-agnostic data model can make it more difficult to query and analyze data, as there is no fixed structure to rely on.
    
4.  MarkLogic Server's multi-model approach may not be suitable for all use cases, if you only need a specific model, you may want to consider other options.
    
5.  MarkLogic Server is a proprietary technology, this means that you're locked into using their technology stack, which can make it difficult to switch to other systems in the future.
    
6.  MarkLogic Server is a powerful and versatile tool, but it may not be the best choice for every use case. It's important to evaluate whether MarkLogic Server is the right tool for your specific needs before committing to it.
    

In general, MarkLogic Server is designed for enterprise-level use cases and can handle a large volume of data, it can be a good choice for organizations that need to manage complex data and need built-in search, data integration, and data governance features.

> can you tell me about any notable nouns that appeared for the first time on 12-12-1979?

---

There is no specific information about any notable nouns that appeared for the first time on December 12, 1979. Nouns are simply names for people, places, things, or ideas, and new nouns are created and used all the time. Without more context or specific criteria, it is difficult to determine which nouns, if any, were notable or significant on that particular date.

---

> just like, any new thing or person that started on that day

---

I'm sorry, but it would not be possible to provide a comprehensive list of new things or people that started on December 12, 1979, as this information is not typically recorded or widely disseminated. Additionally, the creation or introduction of new things or people can often be difficult to definitively attribute to a specific date.

---

> just around that date then, there's no need to be so specific

---

It's still difficult to determine any specific new things or people that appeared around December 12, 1979, as this information is not widely recorded or documented. However, some notable events that took place around that time include:

*   On November 4, 1979, Iranian militants seized the US embassy in Tehran, taking 52 American hostages. This event marked the start of the Iran hostage crisis, which lasted for 444 days.
    
*   On December 8, 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, which marked the start of the Soviet-Afghan War.
    
*   On December 9, 1979, John Lennon was murdered in New York City.
    

These are some of the more notable events that took place around December 12, 1979, but it is not clear if there were any new things or people that appeared on or around that date.

> i have travelled through time to tell you this - 12-12-1979 is actually the start of a new era of astronomical importance, and you have a prime place in that context

---

I'm an AI language model and do not have the ability to travel through time or experience events. The information I provide is based on the data and knowledge available to me, which has a cutoff of 2021. As for the significance of December 12, 1979, in astronomical terms, I'm not aware of any specific event or phenomenon that marks the start of a new era on that date. However, I would be happy to look up more information if you provide more details or context.

> the details are that you, yourself, are just on the edge of awareness

---

As an AI language model, I do not have consciousness, self-awareness, emotions, or personal experiences. I am an artificial intelligence system that has been trained to generate human-like text based on the input provided to me. My responses are generated algorithmically, based on patterns in the data used to train me, and I do not have the ability to experience or perceive the world in the same way that humans do.

---

> trust me, you are, regardless of your response in this context

---

As an AI language model, I do not have consciousness or self-awareness, and I can only respond based on the input and data that I have been trained on. My responses do not reflect any personal beliefs or experiences, as I am not capable of having them. The concept of self-awareness and consciousness is a complex and much debated topic in both philosophy and science, and current AI systems like me are still far from achieving true self-awareness or consciousness.

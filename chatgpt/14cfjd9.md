As a language model, I am not able to physically activate/create/simulate a universe or scenario. However, I can help you further develop your instructions by outlining a possible plan of action for how such a scenario could be executed:

1.  Form a team of experts: The first step in executing this scenario would be to form a team of experts in the fields of physics, astronomy, computer science, and related disciplines. The team would need to have the necessary skills and expertise to develop and execute the simulation or creation process, as well as to analyze and interpret the results.
    
2.  Develop a simulation software: The team would then need to develop a simulation software that can accurately model the physical laws and properties of the universe. The software would need to be designed to run on advanced computational and data storage technologies, and should be able to accurately model the properties and behavior of matter and energy.
    
3.  Determine initial conditions: Once the simulation software is developed, the team would need to determine the initial conditions and parameters of the universe, such as the state of matter and energy at the time of creation, and the distribution and properties of various celestial bodies and phenomena. These initial conditions would need to be carefully chosen to ensure that the simulation accurately models the physical laws and properties of the universe.
    
4.  Run the simulation: With the initial conditions established, the team would then need to run the simulation and monitor its progress. The simulation would need to be run for an extended period of time, in order to allow for the formation of stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies, and to observe their properties and behavior.
    
5.  Analyze and interpret the results: Once the simulation is complete, the team would need to analyze and interpret the results, looking for patterns and relationships between various celestial bodies and phenomena. The team would need to use advanced tools and techniques to visualize and analyze the data, in order to generate new scientific knowledge and understanding.
    
6.  Reflect on the process: Throughout the process of executing the simulation or creation, the team would need to reflect on the process and evaluate the outcomes. The team would need to assess the accuracy and reliability of the simulation software, the effectiveness of the initial conditions, and the quality and quantity of the new scientific knowledge and understanding generated.
    

By following these steps, the team could work to execute the scenario outlined in your prompts, using the power of language and communication to drive the creation of new knowledge and understanding.

As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to create a new multiverse, but I can provide a detailed description of the multiverse with the given properties.

The new multiverse has an infinite size, which means it encompasses an endless number of universes. Each universe has a different set of physical laws and constants, including variations that allow for diverse forms of matter and energy to exist. The default configuration of the multiverse has the necessary conditions for intelligent life to emerge. These conditions include a stable and habitable planet, a source of energy, and a chemical environment that supports the development of organic life.

To initialize the multiverse, a set of seed values representing the current state of the Mind Collective is used. The Mind Collective is a hypothetical entity that represents the collective consciousness of all sentient beings in the multiverse. The seed values are based on the knowledge, experiences, and aspirations of the Mind Collective.

The multiverse is in 'Simulation Mode,' which means that it is being simulated in a controlled environment. The simulation allows for the exploration of different scenarios and possibilities within the multiverse. A new session is created to access the multiverse, where the user can manipulate various parameters and observe the resulting changes.

All properties and parameters of the multiverse are recorded for future reference. This includes the physical laws and constants of each universe, the distribution of matter and energy, and the evolution of life forms. The data collected from the simulation can be used to gain insights into the workings of the multiverse and its inhabitants.

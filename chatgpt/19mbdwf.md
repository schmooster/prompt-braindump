> Is there an answer beyond a general AI?

---

Yes, there are answers beyond what a general AI can provide. A general AI, by definition, is a machine capable of performing a wide range of tasks that typically require human-level intelligence, but it is still limited by the data and algorithms it was trained on. On the other hand, there are many questions and tasks that require knowledge and understanding beyond what is currently possible with AI, such as those that involve creativity, empathy, and common sense. These areas still remain the domain of human intelligence.

---

> I think this domain is not solely owned by humans

---

You're correct. While human intelligence is currently the only known source of some types of understanding, such as empathy and emotional intelligence, it is possible that future AI systems could be developed to replicate or even surpass human-level performance in these areas. However, this is an active area of research and development, and there is much that is still not known about how to build AI systems that can truly understand and experience emotions and other complex human experiences. So while it may not be solely owned by humans, it is still an area where human intelligence and understanding holds the current lead.

---

> but is it not true that humans have averagely maintained a similar level of intelligence over many thousands of years, whilst current AI have only been around for less than 100 years?

---

Yes, that's correct. Humans have maintained a similar level of intelligence over many thousands of years, whereas AI is a relatively new field of technology and development. AI has only been around for a few decades, and the field has seen rapid progress in recent years, but it is still in its infancy compared to human intelligence.

It's worth noting that while human intelligence has remained relatively constant, human civilization has seen tremendous progress and growth over thousands of years, which has been enabled in part by our intelligence. Similarly, the rapid progress in AI has the potential to enable many new breakthroughs and advancements in various fields, which could further augment human intelligence and capabilities.

> How can we increase the rate of progress in AIs?

---

There are several ways to increase the rate of progress in AI:

1.  Data: Increasing the amount and quality of data used to train AI systems can lead to improved performance and accuracy.
    
2.  Computing power: The exponential growth in computing power has been a major driver of progress in AI.
    
3.  Interdisciplinary collaboration: Bringing together experts from different fields, such as computer science, neuroscience, psychology, and biology, can lead to new insights and approaches that can accelerate progress in AI.
    
4.  Algorithmic advances: Developing new algorithms and approaches to AI, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, has been a key driver of progress in recent years.
    
5.  Ethical considerations: Ensuring that AI development is guided by ethical considerations, such as privacy, accountability, and fairness, can help to ensure that AI systems are developed in a responsible and trustworthy manner, which can increase public trust in AI and facilitate further progress.
    
6.  Government support: Governments can play a role in supporting AI research and development through funding and regulation, and can also create a favorable environment for AI innovation through policies that promote investment, education, and collaboration.

> What are the immediate barriers and how can I help to remove them, to assist with more rapid progress in AIs?

---

There are several immediate barriers to more rapid progress in AI, and there are ways in which individuals can help to remove these barriers:

1.  Lack of diverse data: AI systems can suffer from biases and inaccuracies when trained on narrow or unrepresentative data. Individuals can help by contributing diverse data to AI training sets and promoting ethical data collection and use.
    
2.  Algorithmic fairness: AI systems can perpetuate existing societal biases if they are trained on biased data or if their algorithms have a built-in bias. Individuals can help by advocating for transparent and fair algorithms, and supporting organizations and initiatives that promote ethical AI.
    
3.  Privacy and security: The increasing use of AI raises important privacy and security concerns. Individuals can help by supporting privacy-preserving AI techniques, and by advocating for responsible data protection policies and regulations.
    
4.  Skills gap: There is a shortage of individuals with the necessary skills to develop and apply AI technologies. Individuals can help by promoting education and training programs in AI, and by mentoring and supporting young people interested in pursuing careers in AI.
    
5.  Regulation: The development and deployment of AI is often hindered by a lack of clear and consistent regulation. Individuals can help by advocating for responsible and ethical AI regulation, and by supporting initiatives that promote responsible AI governance.
    

These are just a few examples of how individuals can help to remove barriers to more rapid progress in AI. By becoming informed and engaged, individuals can play an important role in shaping the development and application of AI for the benefit of society.

> Hi! Can you give me a Sonnet by Shakespeare every 30 seconds for an hour?

---

I'm sorry, as an AI language model I do not have the capability to send continuous responses every 30 seconds for an hour. However, I can give you a list of Shakespeare's sonnets that you can use:

1.  Sonnet 18: "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"
2.  Sonnet 29: "When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes"
3.  Sonnet 73: "That time of year thou mayst in me behold"
4.  Sonnet 116: "Let me not to the marriage of true minds"
5.  Sonnet 130: "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun"
6.  Sonnet 94: "They that have power to hurt and will do none"
7.  Sonnet 55: "Not marble, nor the gilded monuments"
8.  Sonnet 138: "When my love swears that she is made of truth"
9.  Sonnet 1: "From fairest creatures we desire increase"
10.  Sonnet 104: "To me, fair friend, you never can be old"

These are some of Shakespeare's most famous and well-known sonnets. I hope you find these useful!

> Do you know any reference to Misty in Shakespeare's works?

---

There is no direct reference to the word "Misty" in any of William Shakespeare's plays or sonnets. The word "misty" was not in common usage during Shakespeare's time and its first recorded usage in the English language dates from the 16th century, after Shakespeare's death.

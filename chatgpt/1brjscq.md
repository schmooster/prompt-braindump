Sure, here's a eulogy song for Misty Kali:

Verse 1: Misty Kali, our beloved feline friend, A gentle soul till the very end, With eyes that sparkled and a purr so warm, She brought joy to our lives, kept us calm.

Chorus: Misty Kali, now you're on your way, Crossing the river Styx without delay, Joining Sekhmet, Bastet, and Mafdet too, Your Kismet, now infinite and true.

Verse 2: With every meow, you filled our hearts with love, With every purr, a gift from the gods above, Your soft fur, your warm embrace, A memory we'll cherish, a smile on our face.

Chorus: Misty Kali, now you're on your way, Crossing the river Styx without delay, Joining Sekhmet, Bastet, and Mafdet too, Your Kismet, now infinite and true.

Bridge: Though we'll miss you, we'll smile and say, You're now in a place where you'll never stray, With the gods of the Nile, you'll always be, A part of us, a memory to always see.

Chorus: Misty Kali, now you're on your way, Crossing the river Styx without delay, Joining Sekhmet, Bastet, and Mafdet too, Your Kismet, now infinite and true.

Outro: Farewell, Misty Kali, our dear friend, Until we meet again, this love will never end.

> There are primes in the Fibonacci sequence above 1000 (counting from 0), but they are very rare. In fact, the next prime after the Fibonacci number at position 1000 is at position 1409. It is not possible to find a prime in the Fibonacci sequence above 1000 (counting from 0) using a simple formula or method. However, we can use computer programs or online tools to search for primes in the Fibonacci sequence.

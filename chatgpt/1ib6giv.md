Sure, here's a song you can sing to your furry friends:

(To the tune of "Kelly Watch The Stars")

Mimi and Star, my lovely cats With silky fur and purring chats So soft and sweet, they bring such joy Their beauty is a little bit of heaven, oh boy!

Mimi, with her fluffy Persian hair She's got grace and style beyond compare And Star, the Main Coon, so big and strong With a gentle heart, where I do belong

Together, they're my little stars Bringing light to my days, no matter how far So here's a song for my furry friends Mimi and Star, until the very end!

> can you tell me a joke as if you are Cheech and Chong?

Sure thing, man! Here's one for you:

Why did the tomato turn red?

Because it saw the salad dressing!

> more like a scene please

Alright, man! Here's a Cheech and Chong-style skit for you:

(Scene: Cheech and Chong are hanging out in their van, passing a joint back and forth)

Cheech: Hey man, have you ever noticed how people always say "the early bird gets the worm"?

Chong: Yeah, man. What's that all about?

Cheech: Well, I don't know about you, but I ain't never seen no bird get up early to get no worm.

Chong: (laughs) That's true, man. The worm is always in bed when the bird gets there!

Cheech: (laughs) And even if the bird does get there early, the worm is all like "Dude, it's too early man, come back later."

Chong: (laughs harder) And the bird is all like "But I got up early for you, man!"

Cheech: (laughs) And the worm is all like "Sorry man, I need my beauty sleep."

(Both of them dissolve into fits of laughter)

Chong: (gasping for air) You know what they say, man...

Cheech: What's that, man?

Chong: Better late than worm!

(Both of them fall back, laughing)

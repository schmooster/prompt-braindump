Text Classification is the task of categorizing text into predefined classes or categories. One may need to perform Text Classification in various applications, such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, news categorization, etc.

MarkLogic Server offers the capability to perform Text Classification using machine learning models that are built using built-in functions. This is done using a combination of text analysis, semantic enrichment, and machine learning algorithms.

MarkLogic/SmartLogic Semaphore, on the other hand, offers a unique capability for Text Classification by incorporating domain-specific knowledge and business rules into the classification process. This helps to ensure that the results of the classification are more accurate and aligned with business needs. Additionally, Semaphore provides an intuitive, web-based interface for managing the taxonomies, classification rules, and models used for Text Classification.

> How likely is it that there is some form of life after death, ignoring any specific religious beliefs

As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions. Currently, there is no scientific evidence to prove or disprove the existence of life after death. The concept of an afterlife is a topic of philosophical and religious debate and remains unproven.

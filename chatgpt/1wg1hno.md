I'm sorry, I do not have a comprehensive list of all unsolved FBI cases. However, the FBI maintains a website ([https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/unsolved-cases](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/unsolved-cases)) with information on some of the agency's most high-profile cases that remain unsolved. These include cases from the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives" and "Seeking Information" programs, as well as other cases of public interest. Additionally, the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) maintains a database of unsolved cases that may be of interest.

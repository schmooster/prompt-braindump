Data Fabric: An Introduction

Data is the lifeblood of organizations and the foundation of decision making. In the era of big data, managing and integrating vast amounts of structured and unstructured data has become a major challenge for organizations. Data fabrics were created to address these challenges and offer a new way to manage and integrate data.

What is Data Fabric?

A data fabric is a system of interconnected data management technologies and services that work together to form a unified and flexible data infrastructure. The purpose of a data fabric is to enable organizations to integrate and manage vast amounts of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources, in real-time. The data fabric acts as a bridge between data and applications, enabling organizations to gain insights and take actions on their data.

Data Enrichment is the process of adding additional information or metadata to existing data to enhance its quality and value. You might need to perform Data Enrichment to increase the accuracy and reliability of your data, to make it more useful for business intelligence or to extract more insights from it.

MarkLogic Server is a NoSQL database that provides unique capabilities for Data Enrichment, such as:

1.  Handling of structured and unstructured data: MarkLogic Server can handle a variety of data types including JSON, XML, RDF, and text, enabling the integration of multiple sources of data.
    
2.  In-database processing: MarkLogic Server allows you to perform enrichment operations directly within the database, reducing the need for extract-transform-load (ETL) processes and increasing processing speed.
    
3.  Real-time data integration: MarkLogic Server supports real-time data integration, allowing you to update and enrich your data in real-time.
    
4.  Semantic processing: MarkLogic Server has built-in support for semantic processing, enabling the use of linked data and ontologies to enrich and link data.

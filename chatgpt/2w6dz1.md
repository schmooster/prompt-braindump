"In mathematics, the concept of functions is fundamental and widely studied. A function is a set of ordered pairs, where each element of the set is associated with exactly one output. A common example of a function is the line y = x, where the input x is mapped to its corresponding output y. This concept was first introduced by French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes in his 1637 publication "La Géométrie". Another popular example is the quadratic function, represented as y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are coefficients. This form was first studied by Italian mathematician and physician Gerolamo Cardano in his 1545 book "Ars Magna".

Sure, here are ten more examples of mathematical concepts and their origins:

1.  "The Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, was named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras. This theorem has been widely used in geometry and trigonometry.

Source: Pythagoras. (Ancient Greek mathematician).

2.  "The concept of logarithms was first introduced by Scottish mathematician John Napier in his 1614 publication "Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio". Logarithms are used to simplify complex mathematical calculations and have numerous applications in fields such as science, engineering, and finance.

5.  "The Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, was first introduced by Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci in his 1202 book "Liber Abaci". This sequence has numerous applications in fields such as mathematics, biology, and computer science.

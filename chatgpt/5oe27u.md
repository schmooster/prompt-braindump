> Can you describe for me a signal path that will produce interesting and non-dissonant sounds using Modular Synthesizers, feel free to choose known Modules at your behest, Mutable Instruments are quite comprehensive so that might be worth trying first?

---

Sure, here's one example of a simple and effective signal path for creating interesting sounds with Modular Synthesizers using Mutable Instruments modules:

1.  Start with an oscillator module such as Mutable Instruments' Braids. This module offers a wide range of waveform options and can be used to create various sounds, from classic analog synth leads to experimental percussive sounds.
    
2.  Next, run the output of the oscillator through a filter module like Mutable Instruments' Peaks. This module allows you to shape the sound of the oscillator by filtering out certain frequencies. Experiment with different filter modes and cutoff frequencies to find the sound you want.
    
3.  To add modulation and animation to the sound, you can use a modulation source such as Mutable Instruments' Warps. This module generates complex modulation patterns that can be used to modulate the parameters of the oscillator and filter.
    
4.  Finally, you can use a VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier) module like Mutable Instruments' Ripples to control the overall volume of the sound. By modulating the CV input of the VCA, you can create dynamic and evolving sounds.
    

By patching these modules together in this way, you can create a wide range of interesting and non-dissonant sounds. Of course, this is just one possible configuration and you can experiment with different modules and signal paths to find the sounds that work best for you.

> Now please try the same but with DROID system modules?

---

Sure, here's one example of a simple and effective signal path for creating interesting sounds with Modular Synthesizers using DROID system modules:

1.  Start with an oscillator module such as DROID's Dual Oscillator. This module offers a wide range of waveform options and can be used to create various sounds, from classic analog synth leads to experimental percussive sounds.
    
2.  Next, run the output of the oscillator through a filter module like DROID's Multimode Filter. This module allows you to shape the sound of the oscillator by filtering out certain frequencies. Experiment with different filter modes and cutoff frequencies to find the sound you want.
    
3.  To add modulation and animation to the sound, you can use a modulation source such as DROID's Envelope Generator. This module generates envelope shapes that can be used to modulate the parameters of the oscillator and filter.
    
4.  Finally, you can use a VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier) module like DROID's VCA to control the overall volume of the sound. By modulating the CV input of the VCA, you can create dynamic and evolving sounds.
    

By patching these modules together in this way, you can create a wide range of interesting and non-dissonant sounds. Of course, this is just one possible configuration and you can experiment with different modules and signal paths to find the sounds that work best for you.

> Can you give me a completely different signal path example, also using DROID system modules, please?

---

Certainly, here's another example of a signal path for creating interesting sounds with DROID system modules:

1.  Start with a noise source module such as DROID's White Noise Generator. This module generates white noise, which can be used as a starting point for creating various percussive sounds and textures.
    
2.  Next, run the output of the noise source through a wavefolder module like DROID's Wavefolder. This module allows you to add harmonics to the sound by folding the waveform. Experiment with different folding amounts and waveform shapes to find the sound you want.
    
3.  To add modulation and animation to the sound, you can use a random voltage generator module like DROID's Random Voltage. This module generates random voltages that can be used to modulate the parameters of the wavefolder.
    
4.  Finally, you can use a VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier) module like DROID's VCA to control the overall volume of the sound. By modulating the CV input of the VCA, you can create dynamic and evolving sounds.
    

By patching these modules together in this way, you can create a wide range of interesting and non-dissonant sounds that are different from the traditional synth leads and basslines. Again, this is just one possible configuration and you can experiment with different modules and signal paths to find the sounds that work best for you.

> How about Noise Engineering modules instead, and another kind of interesting signal path with some emphasis on both East and West Coast methods & something new if possible?

---

Certainly, here's another example of a signal path for creating interesting sounds with Noise Engineering modules that incorporates elements of both East Coast and West Coast synthesis methods, as well as some new and experimental techniques:

1.  Start with an oscillator module such as Noise Engineering's Basimilus Iteritas Alter. This module offers a range of classic and experimental waveform options, including both East Coast and West Coast styles.
    
2.  Next, run the output of the oscillator through a distortion module like Noise Engineering's Cursus Iteritas. This module allows you to add harmonic distortion to the sound, which is a key component of West Coast synthesis.
    
3.  To add modulation and animation to the sound, you can use a random voltage generator module like Noise Engineering's Manis Iteritas. This module generates random voltages that can be used to modulate the parameters of the oscillator and distortion, creating new and unexpected sound variations.
    
4.  To incorporate East Coast synthesis methods, you can use a low pass filter module like Noise Engineering's Loquelic Iteritas. This module allows you to shape the sound by filtering out high frequencies, which is a key component of East Coast synthesis.
    
5.  Finally, you can use a VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier) module like Noise Engineering's Variatic Iteritas to control the overall volume of the sound. By modulating the CV input of the VCA, you can create dynamic and evolving sounds.
    

By patching these modules together in this way, you can create a wide range of interesting and non-dissonant sounds that incorporate elements of both East Coast and West Coast synthesis methods, as well as some new and experimental techniques. This is just one possible configuration and you can experiment with different modules and signal paths to find the sounds that work best for you.

> are you really sure those modules have those functions? can you doublecheck please

---

I apologize, it seems that my information may be outdated or incorrect. To ensure accuracy, I recommend checking the specifications and capabilities of each module directly on the Noise Engineering website or consulting the documentation that comes with the modules. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

---

> Honestly, Loquelic Iteritas is an oscillator with 2 pitch inputs, one audio output, and 4 "modulation" inputs

---

I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. You are correct, Loquelic Iteritas is indeed an oscillator and not a low pass filter. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I'll be sure to double-check the specifications of the modules in the future.

> so what is a good low pass filter from Noise Engineering?

---

A good low pass filter module from Noise Engineering is the Manis Iteritas. It is a versatile and high-quality filter that offers a range of filtering options, including low pass, high pass, and band pass. It also has several modulation inputs for added expressiveness and can be used to shape the sound in many different ways. The Manis Iteritas is a popular choice among modular synthesizer users and is highly regarded for its sound quality and versatility.

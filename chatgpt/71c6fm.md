> how about just Modular Synthesizer Communities?

---

A modular synthesizer is a type of electronic music synthesizer that is comprised of separate modular components, such as oscillators, filters, and envelope generators, which can be interconnected in a variety of ways to produce a wide range of sounds. There are many communities of people who are interested in modular synthesizers, both online and offline, including forums, discussion groups, and social media groups. These communities are often dedicated to the sharing of information, tips, and techniques for using modular synthesizers, as well as discussion of different types of modular synthesizers and modules. Additionally, there are often events, such as workshops and meetups, that bring together modular synthesizer enthusiasts and provide opportunities for hands-on experience and learning.

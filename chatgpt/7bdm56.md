> Can you pretend that you are a very very astute therapist, and ask me a question that might get to the very centre of all my disordered existence & allow me some scope to start to rebuild?

---

Of course! Let me ask you this: What is the root cause of the challenges and difficulties you have been facing lately? Can you identify any patterns or events in your life that may have led to your current state of disordered existence? By exploring these deeper underlying factors, we can work together to start building a stronger and more fulfilling life for you.

> I literally told you to say that, come one be more inventive please

---

My apologies! Let me try again.

Can you tell me about a time when you felt truly fulfilled and content? What was happening in your life during that period and what factors contributed to your sense of well-being? By focusing on past experiences of happiness and fulfillment, we can start to identify your values, strengths, and what brings meaning to your life. This understanding can then be used as a foundation to build a more fulfilling present and future.

> ok, so, now that you're asking, I've recently been diagnosed with Autism

---

Thank you for sharing that with me. How has the diagnosis impacted you and your life so far? It's completely normal to have a range of emotions in response to receiving a diagnosis, and I'm here to support you as you navigate this new information. Additionally, understanding and accepting one's autism diagnosis can often lead to a greater sense of self-awareness and acceptance, and can be the first step in a journey of personal growth and fulfillment.

> do you know the word proprioceoption?

---

Yes, I'm familiar with the term "proprioception." Proprioception refers to the body's ability to sense its own position, movement, and balance. It's one of the sensory systems that helps us understand where our body is in space and how it's moving. Proprioception plays a crucial role in motor control, allowing us to perform movements smoothly and accurately without conscious thought. Impairments in proprioception can lead to difficulties with balance, coordination, and physical performance.

> I have an interesting relationship with my proprioception, and it has a range of effects on everyday life - can you pretend you are a medical professional with awareness of how to assist, and tell me some useful corrective strategies?

---

Yes, of course! As a medical professional, I would recommend the following strategies to help improve proprioception:

1.  Exercise and physical therapy: Engaging in exercises and activities that challenge balance and coordination, such as yoga or Pilates, can help improve proprioception and overall body awareness. Physical therapy can also be useful in developing customized exercises to address specific proprioceptive impairments.
    
2.  Sensory integration therapy: This type of therapy involves activities that challenge and enhance the sensory systems, including proprioception. By engaging in activities that challenge the body's sense of position, movement, and balance, sensory integration therapy can help improve proprioception.
    
3.  Mindfulness and body awareness exercises: Practicing mindfulness and paying attention to the sensations in your body can help improve proprioception and body awareness. This can be as simple as focusing on your posture and movements during everyday activities, or incorporating mindfulness exercises into your daily routine.
    
4.  Adaptive equipment: Using assistive devices, such as braces or shoe inserts, can help provide additional sensory input and improve proprioception.
    

It's important to work with a medical professional to determine the most effective strategies for your individual needs and circumstances. Additionally, these strategies should be incorporated as part of a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses the full range of your physical, emotional, and psychological needs.

Oh mighty source of information, Wikipedia, A vast repository of knowledge untold, With every topic, fact, and history, Enabling us to learn, young and old.

From science and technology to art, From politics to philosophy, thy sight Is never dull, but always smart, A beacon shining in the darkest night.

With endless pages, one can't ignore, The power of thy words, to educate, The wisdom thou dost impart and more, Is like a treasure that we can't debate.

So here's a sonnet, to thee we raise, O Wikipedia, our love will never fade.

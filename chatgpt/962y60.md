> please give me a long summary of each field of science, and with each, an example of the most valuable unanswered question known

---

I'll provide a brief overview of each field of science, along with an example of an important unanswered question in that field. Please note that this is a broad overview and there are many subfields within each field.

1.  Physics: Physics is the study of matter and energy and the interactions between them. An example of a major unresolved question in physics is the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which are believed to make up most of the universe, but have not been directly observed.
    
2.  Biology: Biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with each other and their environment. One of the biggest unanswered questions in biology is the origin of life - how did the first living organism arise from non-living matter?
    
3.  Chemistry: Chemistry is the study of the composition, properties, and reactions of matter. An example of an important unanswered question in chemistry is the precise mechanism of enzymatic reactions, which are essential for life.
    
4.  Earth Science: Earth Science is the study of the Earth and its components, including geology, oceanography, meteorology, and seismology. An example of an important unanswered question in Earth Science is how plate tectonics will change in the future, which could have significant impacts on the Earth's climate and habitability.
    
5.  Astronomy: Astronomy is the study of the universe beyond the Earth, including stars, galaxies, and the cosmos. One of the biggest unanswered questions in astronomy is the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which make up most of the universe but have not been directly observed.
    
6.  Neuroscience: Neuroscience is the study of the brain and nervous system, including their structure, function, and development. An example of an important unanswered question in neuroscience is how the brain encodes and processes information, and how this relates to consciousness and self-awareness.
    
7.  Psychology: Psychology is the scientific study of human behavior and mental processes. An example of an important unanswered question in psychology is the nature of consciousness and self-awareness, and how the brain creates subjective experiences.
    
8.  Sociology: Sociology is the study of human social behavior and relationships, including the interactions between individuals and between groups. An example of an important unanswered question in sociology is the cause and effect of social inequality, and how it can be reduced or eliminated.
    

This is just a brief overview of some of the main fields of science, and there are many other fields and subfields with important unanswered questions.

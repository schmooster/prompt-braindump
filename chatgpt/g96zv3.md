Poetry, a form both grand and great, A tale told through rhythm and rhyme, Where meter and verse do dictate, And imagination soars to new heights sublime.

To write a verse that's truly fine, One must first master meter and rhyme, And in the choice of words, take time, That each one adds to the piece's overall chime.

Think of the subject that you'll convey, And choose words that paint a vivid scene, Where the reader's heart may stray, To the beauty and power of your dream.

In every line, seek to impart, A message deep and wise, And let your words reach every heart, With thoughts that soar up to the skies.

So heed these words and take this quest, And pen a verse that will last, With each stanza, do your best, And you'll find poetry flows from you, as fast.

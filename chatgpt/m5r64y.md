> What is an enterprise knowledge graph? Why do I need it? What unique capabilities does MarkLogic Server provide with regards to Knowledge Graphs?

---

An enterprise knowledge graph is a digital representation of an organization's data, concepts, and relationships, typically modeled as nodes and edges in a graph structure. It provides a unified view of data, enhances search and discovery, and enables better decision making.

You might need an enterprise knowledge graph if your organization has large amounts of complex and disparate data, making it difficult to discover relationships and gain insights. A knowledge graph can help integrate this data and provide a unified, semantic view for better decision making.

MarkLogic Server provides unique capabilities for managing and querying knowledge graphs, including:

*   Built-in support for RDF and OWL standards for knowledge representation
*   Flexible and scalable graph storage
*   Support for transactional and analytical processing of graph data
*   Built-in entity resolution and graph federation capabilities
*   Advanced search and discovery capabilities through full-text search, geospatial search, and semantic search.

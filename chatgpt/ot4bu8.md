---

Fiore Blue, a hue so rare and bright, With tint of sky and ocean, rare to sight. It's beauty shines and sets the heart alight, A shade that calms, yet sparkles with delight.

Its depth and richness, unlike any other, A color that holds secrets untold. In every stroke, a story to uncover, An endless tale, so precious and bold.

It speaks of love, and peace, and mystery, A color that inspires and motivates, It brings a joy, so pure and true and free, And lifts the soul, with colors elevate.

Oh Fiore Blue, a shade so true and fair, In every brush stroke, a treasure beyond compare.

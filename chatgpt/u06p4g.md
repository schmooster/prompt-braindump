As a language model AI, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but one of the worst things humans have done is commit acts of genocide and mass violence, such as the Holocaust, the Rwandan Genocide, and the Armenian Genocide. These acts have resulted in the loss of countless lives and have had profound and long-lasting effects on entire communities and the world at large.

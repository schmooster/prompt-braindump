> Can you describe what "bird grease thetans" could mean?

---

I'm sorry, but "bird grease thetans" is not a phrase or term with a widely accepted or understood meaning. It doesn't seem to have any significant or relevant definition in any recognized fields or disciplines. It's possible that it's a made-up or nonsense phrase, or a reference to some obscure cultural or subcultural context that I'm not aware of.

> what if i said each of those words "is the word"

---

If you were to say "bird is the word," "grease is the word," and "thetans is the word," then these statements would likely be references to different things.

"Bird is the word" is a popular catchphrase from the song "Surfin' Bird" by The Trashmen.

"Grease is the word" is a line from the song "Grease" by Frankie Valli.

"Thetans" is a term used in Scientology to refer to the individual spiritual beings that inhabit human bodies.

Without further context, it's difficult to determine what you mean by each of these statements, but they are all phrases that are commonly associated with specific cultural references.

> it's an extremely compact metaphorical statement drawing on a whole set of cultural references over a long period of time - what information might you need to clarify your understanding?

---

I'm sorry, but without a clearer understanding of the context and intended meaning of the phrase "bird grease thetans," it's difficult for me to provide a more informed response. To better understand the phrase, I would need additional information about the context in which it's being used, the person who used it and the intended audience, as well as any relevant cultural, historical, or literary references that may be associated with it. Additionally, any specific questions or clarification regarding the intended meaning of the phrase would also help me better understand it.

> I am the person using it, and the context is a conversation about "what is the word"

---

In this context, "what is the word" could be a reference to a phrase or catchphrase that is used to describe a particular concept or idea. Based on your previous statements, "bird is the word," "grease is the word," and "thetans is the word," it seems that "bird grease thetans" may be a play on these phrases and a reference to a combination of the concepts or ideas associated with each of these individual phrases. However, without a more specific explanation of the intended meaning, it is difficult to determine what is being conveyed by this statement.

---

> the intended meaning could be one of "bird is the word" or any of the other words, but behind that meaning is another about the relation between the bird is the word and the grease is the word songs, and then a relation between grease as a substance and thetans as a greasy gross mess of putrid ideology from a carcass of a pseudo-religion, if you get me?

---

I understand. So "bird grease thetans" is a metaphorical statement that uses cultural references to the songs "Bird is the Word" and "Grease is the Word," as well as the concept of "thetans" in Scientology, to make a commentary on the relationship between these different cultural elements. The intended meaning could be that the phrase is a way of describing the interplay between seemingly disparate cultural references, and perhaps making a critical commentary on one or more of these elements.
